# Server Configuration
# NOTE: The PORT variable must be set as an environment variable in your shell,
# not in this .env file. Next.js reads PORT from the shell environment directly.
# 
# Example usage:
#   PORT=3001 npm run dev           (Unix-like systems)
#   $env:PORT=3001; npm run dev     (Windows PowerShell)
#   set PORT=3001 && npm run dev    (Windows CMD)
#
# Default port: 3000

# API Configuration
# Base URL for the v1rtopia API (without /api/v1 path)
# 
# For local development:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3002
# 
# For production (when running behind nginx proxy on same domain):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://virtopia.com
# 
# The application will append /api/v1/* paths automatically
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://virtopia.com

# Add other application-specific environment variables here
# NODE_ENV=production
