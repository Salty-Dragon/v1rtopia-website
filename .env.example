# Server Configuration
# NOTE: The PORT variable must be set as an environment variable in your shell,
# not in this .env file. Next.js reads PORT from the shell environment directly.
# 
# Example usage:
#   PORT=3001 npm run dev           (Unix-like systems)
#   $env:PORT=3001; npm run dev     (Windows PowerShell)
#   set PORT=3001 && npm run dev    (Windows CMD)
#
# Default port: 3000

# Add other application-specific environment variables here
# NODE_ENV=production
